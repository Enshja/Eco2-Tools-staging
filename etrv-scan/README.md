# etrv2mqtt addon

A addon to scan for thermostats.

This add uses [AdamStrojek](https://github.com/AdamStrojek)'s [libetrv](https://github.com/AdamStrojek/libetrv) libary.

I simply packged this work to make it easy to use with Home Assistant.

this project is for [Danfoss eco2 thermostats](https://www.danfoss.com/en-gb/products/radiator-and-room-thermostats/dhs/radiator-thermostats/electronic-radiator-thermostats/#tab-overview)
